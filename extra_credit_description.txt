For my extra credit, I wrote solar_interactive.py. This is a version of solar.py that allows the user to create new planets using the mouse. You can click anywhere on the screen to make a new planet. The longer you hold your mouse click, the larger the planet's mass and radius. The planet's orbital velocity is automatically calculated based on its distance away from the sun. The x and y components of this velocity are determined using trig.
